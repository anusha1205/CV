    <p><b>Alphonse Daudet</b>(1840-1897) was a French novelist
        and short-story writer. The Last Lesson is set in the
        days of the Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871) in which
        France was defeated by Prussia led by Bismarck.
        Prussia then consisted of what now are the nations of
        Germany, Poland and parts of Austria. In this story the
        French districts of Alsace and Lorraine have passed
        into Prussian hands. Read the story to find out what
        effect this had on life at school.</p>

    <p>I started for school very late that morning and was in great
        dread of a scolding, especially because M. Hamel had said
        that he would question us on participles, and I did not
        know the first word about them. For a moment I thought of
        running away and spending the day out of doors. It was so
        warm, so bright! The birds were chirping at the edge of the
        woods; and in the open field back of the sawmill the
        Prussian soldiers were drilling. It was all much more
        tempting than the rule for participles, but I had the
        strength to resist, and hurried off to school.
        <br>When I passed the town hall there was a crowd in
        front of the bulletin-board. For the last two years all our
        bad news had come from there — the lost battles, the draft,
        the orders of the commanding officer — and I thought to
        myself, without stopping, “What can be the matter now?”</br></p>
    <p>Then, as I hurried by as fast as I could go, the
        blacksmith, Wachter, who was there, with his apprentice,
        reading the bulletin, called after me, “Don’t go so fast,
        bub; you’ll get to your school in plenty of time!”</p>
    <p>I thought he was making fun of me, and reached
        M. Hamel’s little garden all out of breath.</p>
    <p>Usually, when school began, there was a great bustle,
        which could be heard out in the street, the opening and
        closing of desks, lessons repeated in unison, very loud, with
        our hands over our ears to understand better, and the
        teacher’s great ruler rapping on the table. But now it was
        all so still! I had counted on the commotion to get to my
        desk without being seen; but, of course, that day everything
        had to be as quiet as Sunday morning. Through the window
        I saw my classmates, already in their places, and M. Hamel
        walking up and down with his terrible iron ruler under his
        arm. I had to open the door and go in before everybody. You
        can imagine how I blushed and how frightened I was.</p>
    <p>But nothing happened. M. Hamel saw me and said
        very kindly, “Go to your place quickly, little Franz. We were
        beginning without you.”</p>
    <p>I jumped over the bench and sat down at my desk. Not
        till then, when I had got a little over my fright, did I see
        that our teacher had on his beautiful green coat, his frilled shirt, and the little black silk
        cap, all embroidered, that he
        never wore except on
        inspection and prize days.
        Besides, the whole school
        seemed so strange and
        solemn. But the thing that
        surprised me most was to
        see, on the back benches that
        were always empty, the village
        people sitting quietly like
        ourselves; old Hauser, with
        his three-cornered hat, the
        former mayor, the former
        postmaster, and several others besides. Everybody looked
        sad; and Hauser had brought an old primer, thumbed at
        the edges, and he held it open on his knees with his great
        spectacles lying across the pages.</p>
    <p>While I was wondering about it all, M. Hamel mounted
        his chair, and, in the same grave and gentle tone which he
        had used to me, said, “My children, this is the last lesson
        I shall give you. The order has come from Berlin to teach
        only German in the schools of Alsace and Lorraine. The
        new master comes tomorrow. This is your last French
        lesson. I want you to be very attentive.”</p>
    <p>What a thunderclap these words were to me!</p>
    <p>Oh, the wretches; that was what they had put up at
        the town-hall!</p>
    <p>My last French lesson! Why, I hardly knew how to
        write! I should never learn any more! I must stop there, then!
        Oh, how sorry I was for not learning my lessons, for seeking
        birds’ eggs, or going sliding on the Saar! My books, that had
        seemed such a nuisance a while ago, so heavy to carry, my
        grammar, and my history of the saints, were old friends now
        that I couldn’t give up. And M. Hamel, too; the idea that he
        was going away, that I should never see him again, made me
        forget all about his ruler and how cranky he was.</p>
    <p>Poor man! It was in honour of this last lesson that he
        had put on his fine Sunday clothes, and now I understood why the old men of the village were sitting there in
        the
        back of the room. It was because they were sorry, too, that
        they had not gone to school more. It was their way of
        thanking our master for his forty years of faithful service
        and of showing their respect for the country that was theirs
        no more.</p>
